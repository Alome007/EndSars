    <string name="text_template">Dear sir/ma, I am  a concerned citizen of your constituent, and I\'ll like to express my displeasure about SARS. The members of this squad who are supposed to protect us against armed robbery are killing, extorting and harassing us everyday. We are scared to move freely and we need your help. I urge you, distinguished, to use your office to protect the lives of Nigerian youths as we are the future of the Nation. We are counting on you to do the right thing. We are counting on you to help us #ENDSARS. Thanks!</string>
    <string name="whatsapp_msg">*ATTENTION* ‼️‼️ Why The Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) Must be Scrapped. The Special Anti robbery Squad is a unit in the Nigerian Police Force originally formed to combat robberies. Unfortunately, officers of the unit who mostly dress in mufti and carry Ak 47 guns in unmarked cars have engaged in several cases of kidnapping, murder, theft, rape, torture, illegal raids, unlawful arrests, highhandedness, humiliation, unlawful detention and extortion (both documented and undocumented).  These activities are carried out under the pretext of looking for thieves and fraudsters. For no reason at all, many innocent Nigerians have been killed by these dangerous police officers. Some of them are: ▪️ *Remi*, killed in Osogbo, September 15 2020 ▪️ *Tina Ezwkwe*, 17 year old girl, killed for standing at a bus stop in Lagos in 2020 ▪️ *Akinola Lasisi*, 33 year old man killed in Sagamu, Ogun State ▪️ *Femi Bello*, killed in Nasarawa in 2014 ▪️ *Kolade Johnson*, who was killed while watching a football match in Lagos ▪️ *Tiamiyu Kazeem*, aka Kaka, footballer at Remo Stars FC, killed in Sagamu, Ogun State ▪️ *Ifeoma Abugu*, raped and murdered in a SARS Station in 2020 ▪️ *Chibuike Anams*, killed while relaxing with a friend ▪️ *Christian Ugwuoke*, killed while attending his aunt’s wake keep ▪️ *Aneka Okorie*, killed for not paying bribe ▪️ *Ayomide Taiwo*, killed for not giving 50 naira bribe ▪️ *Godspower Edoha*, killed in his home ▪️ These are just some of the hundreds of innocent Nigerian youths killed by SARS officers. For many years, Nigerians have protested and written petitions for the SRAS unit to be scrapped but nothing has changed. After numerous failed promises from the federal Government and reforms that did not change anything, young Nigerians are protesting in many cities and the protest is attracting international attention. Nigerians in the Diaspora are also joining on social media.  We need everyone to join us this time around so that this unit can be scrapped once and for all because the officers have proven that they are beyond being reformed. We know that the entire force needs to be overhauled but this killer squad must go first. Please join us at these protests, encourage us with your voice and money, lobby and talk to your friends in power, and release your wards to protest. We are all that we have, our voices must be heard. Signed, Millions of Nigerian Youths Protesting</string>
